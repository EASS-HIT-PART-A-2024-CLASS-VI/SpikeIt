# SpikeIt Project

## 📌 Overview
SpikeIt is a microservices-based application for managing volleyball workouts. It consists of three microservices:
1. **Backend Microservice** - Handles API requests using FastAPI.
2. **Database Microservice** - Manages SQLite database operations.
3. **Frontend Microservice** - Provides a Streamlit-based UI.

This README provides setup instructions, including installation, testing, and running the project.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (`venv`) for running tests
- Docker & Docker Compose for running the application

---

## 🚀 Setting Up for Testing (Without Docker)
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/projects  # Change as needed

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spikeit.git
cd spikeit
```

### **2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment for Testing**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies for Testing**
Each microservice has its own dependencies, install them separately:
```bash
pip install -r backend_microservice/requirements.txt
pip install -r db_microservice/requirements.txt
pip install -r frontend_microservice/requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Running Unit Tests
We use **pytest** for unit testing. No need to run Docker since we mock external dependencies.

### **🔹 Backend Microservice Tests**
```bash
cd backend_microservice/tests
pytest unit_test.py
```

### **🔹 Database Microservice Tests**
```bash
cd ../../db_microservice/tests
pytest unit_test.py
```

### **🔹 Frontend Microservice Tests**
```bash
cd ../../frontend_microservice/test
pytest unit_test.py
```

If everything is correct, you should see `PASSED` messages.

To exit the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

---

## 🏗️ Running the Application with Docker Compose
Since the application is designed to run inside Docker, use the following commands to start it:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Once started:
- Backend runs on **http://localhost:8000**
- Database runs on **http://localhost:8001**
- Frontend runs on **http://localhost:8501**

To stop the services, use:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 🛠️ Debugging & Common Issues
- **Virtual environment not found?** Run `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
- **Port conflicts?** Ensure no other service is using ports `8000`, `8001`, or `8501`.
- **Tests failing due to missing modules?** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the respective microservice directory.
- **Docker network issues?** Try `docker-compose down --volumes` and restart.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
This README provides all necessary steps to install, test, and run the SpikeIt project. Use the virtual environment only for testing and Docker for full application deployment. Let us know if you need further assistance! 🚀
